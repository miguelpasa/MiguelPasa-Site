              <p>Included above is a screenshot of an ad for my ideal job. The job refers to building some RESTful Java Services that integrate with the company's front end services. Their architecture is monolithic, but the company wishes to modularise their solutions more in time, so this could also be part of the job. This is appealing to me firstly because I love Java. I also appreciate the challenge of a difficult solution, and I know that RESTful Java Services can be quite complex, perhaps implementing things like multithreading or even big data algorithms depending on the service needed.</p>
              <p>Skills include experience in Java, Java server technologies (Spring, Spring Boot), the REST design (including REST API design), Java compilation and export technologies (Maven or Gradle) and experience with solutions for distributed systems. Other skills include infrastructure knowledge to do with Docker, AWS and FIX, and other backend technologies. The ad doesn't list any qualifications needed, however, I believe since it is a Mid to Senior level position, it would probably require a University degree in some Computer Science area, and also experience working in the IT industry.</p>
              <p>I have extensive skills in Java, including REST APIs and designing solutions for the REST design. I also have experience using Java Spring and Spring Boot, and in using both Maven and Gradle and I have experience using JUnit to promote Test Driven Development. I feel I have enough experience to go into the job confidently with these things. However, I don't know how to develop solutions that would suit an architecture that is supported by distributed systems. I am also not very experienced with AWS, Docker, Kotlin or FIX protocol.</p>
              <p>In order to improve these, I would like to take university courses that would give me more knowledge in backend service hosting and also gain more knowledge with Infrastructure - regarding the infrastructure of a network, and how best to identify the suitable design in the services that will be used for that network. Uni courses, web tutorials and youtube videos will help me get some of the way, but I will also have to experiment with this in my free time.</p>

            <div class="pull-left">
              <p>The results of these tests, to me, show that I am a sociable and extroverted individual who is a quick thinker, and open to ideas. The VARK test also indicates that I am able to learn using many different modes, which hopefully means that I am an "all-rounder" in terms of learning.</p>
              <p>I believe that due to the results shown above, I would be able to push myself to have more of a leader role in a group. A leader should be able to be sociable, while also being open to all ideas and be able to apply themselves in many situations. My next factor other than Extrovert and Openness in the Big 5 Personality Test is Agreeableness, which is also a quality desired in a leader. A leader that is agreeable is prefered over a leader that makes poor decisions that could be disagreed with.</p>
              <p>When forming a team, I will consider that my results above show that I am likely suited to a leader role. With this in mind, I might let another person take the lead and see how they perform first, as perhaps I can learn something from them leading. Then I will try being the leader in a group. When forming a group, I should look for others who are similarly Open - so they are able to listen to everyone's ideas and mine. Otherwise, I believe I would be able to perform well with anyone in a group, given that they are Open to ideas and willing to contribute.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Free Parker - A voice interface module that allows users to find places to parking.<h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <div class="pull-left">
              <p><strong>What is it?</strong> Free Parker will be a module which can be added to a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa system. It uses data which is provided by Melbourne Data, which gets refreshed every 2 minute to give the user an idea of where they will be able to park for free. It will be able to give predictions on parking, and also give updates on parking spots. This allows the user to ask questions such as "Will I be able to park here at this time?", "Can I park here right now?" and "Find a spot near me".</p>
              <p><strong>What is our motivation?</strong> According to the Australian Beureau of Statistics, in an article published by The Age in October 2017, featuring data taken from the Census in 2016, 74.4% of Melbournians drive to work by car. According to the 2016 Census, that's 1,274,268 individuals. With this many driving to work, there is sure to be a high percentage of these users struggling to find parking especially in busy areas. Finding parking is an activity done while in the car. When driving, your hands and your eyes are busy, which means the Voice interface is a perfect for Free Parker.</p>
              <p><strong>How are we going to do it?</strong> Free Parker will use data exposed by Melbourne Data which pertains to the status of several parking bays and parking sensors. Using an API endpoint provided by Melbourne Data, Free Parker will be able to track and provide the location of free parking spots. A link to the data access points can be found <a href="https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/On-street-Parking-Bay-Sensors/vh2v-4nfs" target="_blank">here</a>. Using the data given to us, we will be able to monitor the results that are given for a given time. We can then use these results to calculate the probability that there is at least one free parking spot at any location at any time. In this way, we will be able to provide users with the service of Predictive Free Parking. This will allow drivers to know where to drive to in advanced, based on the fact that they want parking there. Since the data returned by the API gets updated every 2 minutes, our predictions can also be filtered to that level of specificity. This means that drivers will be able to ask "Find me a free spot in this place in 5 minutes", allowing them to change their trip accordingly, due to the specificity of the API. The Voice interface is important because the main users of this program will be drivers who are currently behind the wheel, or passengers riding in a car. It could also even be used by people who are just about to leave their houses. This is perfect, because the Voice interface is meant to be used for "hands-busy eyes-busy" situations, exactly like driving. Being a voice module, it can also easily integrate into any Voice service vendor, e.g. Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Samsung Bixby or Apple's Siri. Since most cars these days have some technology that allows the phone to connect, simply connecting your phone should be enough to be able to fire off the service. For example, most Android phones are capable of launching Google Assistant. Given the phone is connected to the car, the same Google Assistant can be used to start the Free Parker voice module. This way, the service will work regardless of device. Phone, computer, car, watch will all be able to run Free Parker as long as they have some sort of Voice agent.</p>

Software that needs to be made is the Dialogflow conversation and the Java Spring Boot application, used to retrieve data from Melbourne Data. Hardware needed is a voice device (e.g. a phone). It will not be hard to come across someone with Java experience, as Java is taught as a first year subject at RMIT. It will also not be hard to upskill anyone in Dialogflow. It is an easy platform to learn and use. It will also be very easy to obtain a voice device. </p>
